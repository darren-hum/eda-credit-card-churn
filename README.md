### Problem
Customer acquisition is usually more costly to the business than retaining an existing customer. In this EDA we look at churn data for credit card customers, to analyze the possible factors involved in churn, for the bank to have actionable insights.

EDA will not be using ML techniques.

Data set is acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers
